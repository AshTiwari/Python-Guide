Algebraic Operators

1) Addition
Adds values on either side of the operator.	
a + b = 31
       

2)Subtraction	
Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.
20 â€“ 30 = -10
       

3)Multiplication	
Multiplies values on either side of the operator	
5 * 6 = 30


4)Float Division	
Divides left hand operand by right hand operand
5 / 2 = 2.5
4 / 2 = 2.0
      

5)Integer Division/Floor Division 
  
  - If either one is float, the answer is float.
  - The division is similar to floor function in maths. 
        i.e 3.45 ==> 3
        &  -3.45 ==> -4
   E.g.
    9//2 = 4 
    9.0//2.0 = 4.0, 
   -11//3 = -4, 
   -11.0//3 = -4.0
   
   
6) Exponent	
Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators. a raise to b	

2**3 =8 
	     

7) Modulus	
 returns remainder	when a divides b
 5 % 2 = 1
 

8) Round Function
      print(round(expression, no. of decimal places)
      
      E.g.
      print(round( 5/3 , 4 )
      O/P: 1.6666
      
      
9) Precedence Rule
